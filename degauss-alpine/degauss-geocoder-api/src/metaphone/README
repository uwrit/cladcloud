= SQLite 3 Metaphone extension =

 * This library implements the Metaphone algorithm, originally developed by
   Laurence Phillips, as an SQLite 3 extension function:

     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone

 * This code is based around the original public domain implementation in
   C by Gary Phillips, as provided by Sadi Evren Seker:

    http://www.shedai.net/c/new/METAPHON.C

 * Like SQLite and the Phillips implementation of Metaphone, this code
   is provided in the public domain, in the hope that it will be useful.

 * To compile the code, simply run `make`. You must have GNU Make and GCC
   installed.

 * The module implements one function, metaphone(), which takes a string
   to convert to a metaphone representation as its first argument, and an
   optional second argument to specify the maximum length of the output.

 * To use the code, run `sqlite3` and enter the following:

{{{
    sqlite> .load /path/to/metaphone.so
            -- you can use ./metaphone.so if the .so is in your 
            -- current directory, or just metaphone.so if it's
            -- somewhere in your library path.
    sqlite> select metaphone("Schuyler");
    SKLR
    sqlite> select metaphone("Schuyler", 3);
    SKL
    sqlite> select metaphone("Skyler");
    SKLR
    sqlite> select metaphone("Skylar");
    SKLR
    sqlite> select metaphone("SQLite rules!");
    SKLTRLS
    sqlite> select metaphone("SQLite roolz!!!1!");
    SKLTRLS
}}}
